### Title Case

Title (or headline) case capitalization is where the first letter of most words is capitalized,
but not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions
(except if any of these are the first or last word in the sentence or phrase).

### Sentence Case

Use sentence case capitalization for all UI text elements.
Capitalize only the initial letter of the first word in the text
and other words that require capitalization, such as proper nouns.
